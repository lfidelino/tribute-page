          <span class="font-bold text-2xl">Alan Turing</span> was an English mathematician, computer scientist,
          logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the
          development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalization of the concepts of algorithm and
          computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. Turing is
          widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. Despite these
          accomplishments, he was never fully recognized in his home country during his lifetime due to the prevalence
          of homophobia at the time and because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley
          Park, Britain's code breaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the section
          that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the
          breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical
          machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the
          Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in so doing helped win the war.
          Due to the problems of counterfactual history, it is hard to estimate the precise effect Ultra intelligence
          had on the war, but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more
          than two years and saved over 14 million lives.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing
          Engine.The Automatic Computing Engine was one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948,
          Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory, at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he
          helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the
          chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky
          reaction, first observed in the 1960s.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts; the Labouchere Amendment of 1885 had mandated that "gross
          indecency" was a criminal offence in the UK. He accepted chemical castration treatment, with DES, as an
          alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An
          inquest determined his death as a suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent
          with accidental poisoning.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology
          on behalf of the British government for "the appalling way he was treated". Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing
          a posthumous pardon in 2013. The "Alan Turing law" is now an informal term for a 2017 law in the United
          Kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed
          homosexual acts.
